## Summary:

The project was nicely excecuted, and it was possible to reach the goals of the functionality of the web page, nevertheless as a conclusion I would like to expose a drawback and of course additional recommendations for further development. 

A drawback in the user´s experience side is that after filtering the data, the user must erase the introduced variables to refresh the data to the initial data. This is not optimal for users´ confort. 

I would recommend to work on a button to "re home" the data so the user can start from fresh and not do "the work" of pressing a button. And for me it would be functional to be able to save searches, so whenever the user wants to compare information or display it again he can do that. Sometimes users miss something and want to go back to excactly where they were.
